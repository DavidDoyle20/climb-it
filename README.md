# ClimbIt Habit Builder

## Description

- The goal of the application is to apply progressive overload principles from sports science into habits
- This app doesn't stop at just building the habit but pushed you to build your capacity for doing specific habits
- This app will also generate progressions for you based on your stystemic stress and recovery calculated through questions on current mental state and body feel
- If your goal is to learn a new language the app may start you at only doing 15 mins every other day, but over months you may be doing 2-3 hours a day of language learning given you have the time.

## Why?

- I love habits and I feel they are a mental cheat code for making progress but I often get lazy once I form the bare minimum habit and it may slowly wither over time. This app attempts to target this issue by constantly challenging you a alot, then letting off a little bit to recover, and then challenging you again.
- I think the idea of pushing yourself just a little bit further than you can sustain and then recovering before you do it again applies to everything in life but I don't have an app for that so here it is.
